## Foreword

These Rules of the Game will take effect on 1 July 2016.

The Rules Text, the Comments, the IHF Hand Signals, the Clarifications to the Rules of the
Game, and the Substitution Area Regulations are all components of the overall rules.

Please also note the integrated “Guidelines and Interpretations” that give additional
guidance on the application of certain rules. The former version published in 2010 with
updates is no longer valid. The “Guidelines and Interpretations” will be expanded, if
required.

The “Guidelines for Playing Courts and Goals”, which are simply included in the rule book
for the convenience of the users of that text, are not an integral part of the rules.

***Note:***

*For the sake of simplicity, this rule book generally uses the male form of words with respect
to players, officials, referees and other persons.*

*However, the rules apply equally to male and female participants, except as regards the rules
for the size of the balls to be used (see Rule 3).*

## Rules of the Game













 











 









## Hand Signals

When a throw-in or free throw is called, the referees must show immediately the
direction for the throw that is to follow (signals 7 or 9).

Thereafter, as applicable, the appropriate obligatory hand signal(s) should be given, to
indicate any personal punishment (signals 13-14).

If it seems that it would also be useful to explain the reason for a free-throw or 7-metre
throw decision, then the applicable one of signals 1-6 and 11 could be given for the sake
of information. Signal 11 should, however, always be given in those situations where a
free-throw decision for passive play was not preceded by signal 17.

Signals 12, 15 and 16 are mandatory in those situations where they apply.

Signals 8, 10 and 17 are used as deemed necessary by the referees.

2. Time-Out ([2:8](#2:8))
3. Team Time-Out ([2:10](#2:10))
4. Passive Play ([7:11-12](#7:11))
5. Throw-Off ([10:3](#10:3))

8. Injured Player ([4:11](#4:11))

### 1. Free-Throw Execution after the Final Signal (2:4-6)
In many cases, the team that has the opportunity to execute a free throw after the playing time
has expired is not really interested in trying to score a goal, either because the outcome of the
game is already clear or because the position for the free throw is too far away from the goal
of the opponents. Although technically the rules require that the free throw be executed, the
referees should show good judgment and consider the free throw taken if a player who is in
the approximately correct position simply lets the ball drop or hands it to the referees.

In those cases where it is clear that the team wants to try to score a goal, the referees must try
to find a balance between allowing this opportunity (even though it is a very small one) and
ensuring that the situation does not deteriorate into a time-consuming and frustrating
“theatre”. This means that the referees should get the players from both teams into correct
positions firmly and quickly so that the free throw can be executed without delay. The new
restrictions in Rule 2:5 regarding player positions and substitutions must be enforced (4:5 and
13:7).

The referees must also be very alert to other punishable violations by the two teams.
Persistent encroachment by the defenders must be punished (15:4, 15:9, 16:1b, 16:3d).
Moreover, the attacking players often violate the rules during the execution, e.g. one or more
players cross the free throw line after the whistle but before the throw (13:7, 3rd paragraph),
or the thrower actually moves or jumps when throwing (15:1, 15:2, 15:3).

It is very important not to allow any goals scored illegally

### 2. Time-Out (2:8)

Apart from the situations indicated in Rule 2:8, where a time-out is obligatory, the referees are
expected to use their judgment regarding the need for time-outs also in other situations. Some
typical situations where time-outs are not obligatory but nevertheless tend to be given in
normal circumstances are:

- a) there are external influences, e.g. the court must be wiped;
- b) a player seems to be injured;
- c) a team is clearly wasting time, e.g. when the team is delaying the execution of a formal
  throw, or when a player is throwing the ball away or not releasing it;
- d) if the ball touches the ceiling or a fixture above the court (11:1), and the ball is
  deflected so that it goes far away from the location of the resulting throw-in, causing
  an unusual delay;
- e) replacing a court player with a goalkeeper in order to execute a goalkeeper throw.

When determining the need for a time-out in these and other situations, the referees should
foremost take into consideration whether an interruption of the game without a time-out
would create an unfair disadvantage for one of the teams. For instance, if a team is leading by
a very clear margin late in the game, then it might not be necessary to make a time-out during
a brief interruption to wipe the court. Similarly, if the team that would be disadvantaged by
the lack of a time-out is the team that, for some reason, is itself causing a delay or wasting
time, then there is obviously no reason for a time-out.

Another important factor is the expected duration of the interruption. The length of an
interruption caused by an injury is often difficult to estimate, so it may then be safer to call a
time-out. Conversely, the referees should not be too quick to call a time-out just because the
ball has left the playing court. In such cases the ball is often back and ready to be played
almost immediately. If not, the referees should concentrate on getting a reserve ball into play
quickly (3:4), precisely in order to make a time-out unnecessary.

The obligatory time-out in connection with 7-metre throws has been removed. It may still be
necessary to give a time-out based on subjective judgment on some occasions, in accordance
with the principles just discussed. This may involve situations where one of the teams clearly
delays the execution, including for instance through a substitution of the goalkeeper or the
thrower.

### 3. Team Time-Out (2:10)
Each team has the right to receive one 1-minute team time-out in each half of the regular
playing time (but not in overtime).

A team that wishes to request a team time-out must do so by having a team official place a
green card on the table in front of the timekeeper. It is recommended that the green card
measures about 15 x 20 cm and has a large “T” on each side.

A team may request their team time-out only when it has possession of the ball (when the ball
is in play or during an interruption). Provided that the team does not lose possession before
the timekeeper has time to whistle (in which case the green card would be returned to the
team), the team will be granted the team time-out immediately.

The timekeeper then interrupts the game by blowing the whistle, and stops the clock (2:9). He
gives the hand signal for time-out (no. 15) and points with a stretched arm at the team that
requested the team time-out.

The green card is placed on the table, on the side of the team that requested the team time-out,
and remains there during the time-out.

The referees acknowledge the team time-out, and the timekeeper starts a separate clock
controlling the duration of the team time-out. The scorekeeper enters the time of the team
time-out in the score sheet for the team that requested it.

During the team time-out the players and team officials remain at the level of their
substitution areas, either on the court or in the substitution area. The referees stay in the centre
of the court, but one of them may briefly go to the timekeeper’s table for consultation.

For the purpose of punishments under Rule 16, a team time-out is defined as being part of the
playing time (16:10), so any unsportsmanlike conduct and other infractions are punished in
the normal way. It is irrelevant in this context, if the player/official concerned is on or off the
court. Accordingly, a warning, suspension or disqualification under Rules 16:1-3 and 16:6-9
can be given for unsportsmanlike conduct (8:7-10) or for action falling under Rule 8:6b.

After 50 seconds the timekeeper gives an acoustic signal indicating that the game is to be
continued in 10 seconds.

The teams are obliged to be ready to resume play when the team time-out expires. The game
is restarted either with the throw that corresponds to the situation that existed when the timeout
was granted or, if the ball was in play, with a free throw for the team requesting the team
time-out from the place where the ball was at the time of the interruption.

When the referee blows the whistle the timekeeper starts the clock.

***Note:***

*If the IHF, continental confederations or national federations apply deviating regulations
according to the Note under Rule 2:10, each team has the right to receive a maximum of three
team time-outs during regular playing time but not during overtime. No more than two team
time-outs may be granted in each half of the regular playing time. Between two team timeouts
of a team, the opponent must be at least once in possession of the ball. 3 green cards,
bearing numbers 1, 2, and 3 respectively, are available for each team.*

*The teams receive cards bearing numbers ‘1’ and ‘2’ in the first half of the game and the
cards no. 2 and no. 3 in the second half provided they received no more than one team timeout
in the first half. In case they received two team time-outs in the first half, they receive only
green card no. 3.*

*Within the last five minutes of the regular playing time only one team time-out per team is
allowed.*

### 4. Passive Play (7:11-12)

#### A. General Guidelines

The application of the rules regarding passive play has the objective of preventing unattractive
methods of play and intentional delays in game. This requires that the referees throughout the
game recognise and judge passive methods in a consistent manner.

Passive methods of play may arise in all phases of a team’s attack, i.e. when the ball is moved
down the court, during the build-up phase, or during the finishing phase.

Passive ways of playing are typically used more frequently in the following situations:
- a team is narrowly in the lead towards the end of the game;
- a team has a player suspended;
- when the ability of the opponent is superior, especially on defence.

The criteria mentioned in the following specifications rarely apply alone, but must generally
be judged in their entirety by the referees. In particular, the impact of active defensive work in
conformity with the rules must be taken into account.

#### B. The Utilisation of the Forewarning Signal 

The forewarning signal should be shown particularly in the following situations:

##### B1. Forewarning signal when substitutions are made slowly or when the ball is moved slowly down the court

Typical indications are:

- players are standing around in the middle of the court waiting for substitutions to be
  completed;
- a player is delaying the execution of a free throw (by pretending not to know the
  correct spot), a throw-off (by a slow recovery of the ball by the goalkeeper, by an
  intentionally erratic pass to middle, or by slow walking with the ball to the middle), a
  goalkeeper throw, or a throw-in, after the team has previously been admonished to
  refrain from such delaying tactics;
- a player is standing still bouncing the ball;
- the ball is played back into the team’s own half of the court, even though the
  opponents are not putting on any pressure.
  
##### B2. Forewarning signal in connection with a late substitution during the build-up phase 

Typical indications are:

- all players have already taken up their attacking positions;
- the team starts the build-up phase with a preparatory passing play;
- not until this stage does the team undertake a substitution.

***Comment:***

*A team which has attempted a rapid counter-attack from its own half of the court, but has
failed to get to an immediate scoring opportunity after reaching the opponents’ half of the
court, must be allowed to undertake a quick substitution of players at that stage.*

##### B3. During an excessively long build-up phase

In principle, a team must always be allowed a build-up phase with a preparatory passing play
before they can be expected to start a targeted attacking situation.

Typical indications of an excessively long build-up phase are:

- the team’s attack does not lead to any targeted attacking action;

***Comment:***

*A targeted attacking action exists particularly when the team in ball possession uses tactical
methods to move in such a way that they gain spatial advantage over the defenders, or when
they increase the pace of the attack in comparison with the build-up phase.*

- players are repeatedly receiving the ball while standing still or moving away from the
  goal;
- repeated bouncing of the ball while standing still;
- when confronted by an opponent, the attacking player turns away prematurely, waits
  for the referees to interrupt the game, or gains no spatial advantage over the defender;
- active defensive actions: active defensive methods preventing the attackers from
  increasing the pace because the defenders block the intended ball movements and
  running paths;
- a special criterion for excessively long build-up phases is when the attacking team
  achieves no clear increase in pace from the build-up phase to the finishing phase.

#### How the Forewarning Signal should be used 

If a referee (either the court referee or the goal-line referee) recognises the emergence of
passive play, he lifts the arm (hand signal no.17), to indicate the judgment that the team is not
trying to get into a position to take a shot on goal. The other referee should also give the
forewarning signal.

The forewarning signal conveys that the team in possession is not making any attempt to
create a scoring opportunity, or that it is repeatedly delaying the restart of the game.
The hand signal is maintained until:

- the attack is over, or
- the forewarning signal is no longer valid (see comments below).

An attack begins when the team gets into possession of the ball, and is considered over when
the team scores a goal or loses possession.

The forewarning signal normally applies for the entire remainder of the attack. However,
during the course of an attack, there are two situations where the judgment of passive play is
no longer valid, and the forewarning signal is to be stopped:

1) the team in possession takes a shot on goal and the ball rebounds directly to the
   attacking team from the goal or the goalkeeper, or results in a throw-in for that team;
2) a player or team official of the defending team is given a personal punishment under
   Rule 16 due to a foul or unsportsmanlike conduct.
   
In these two situations, the team in possession must be allowed a new build-up phase.

#### D. After the Forewarning Signal has been shown

After showing the forewarning signal, the referees should allow the team in possession of the
ball some time to change their action. In this regard, the skill level in different age and
performance categories must be taken into account.

The team forewarned should thus be allowed the possibility to prepare a targeted attacking
action towards the goal.

If the team in possession does not make a recognisable attempt to get into position to take a
shot on goal (decision-making criteria see D1 and D2), then one of the referees decides that
this is passive play at the latest when no shot on goal is executed after 6 passes (7:11-12).

The following actions are not considered as passes:

- If an attempted pass cannot be controlled due to a penalised foul by a defending player.
- If an attempted pass is deflected by a defending player out over the side line or the outer goal line.
- A throwing attempt that is blocked by the opponent.

***Decision-making** criteria after showing the forewarning signal:*

##### D1. The attacking team:
- no clear increase in pace;
- no targeted action towards the goal;
- 1-on-1 actions where no spatial advantage is achieved;
- delays when playing the ball (e.g., because the passing routes are blocked by the defending team).

##### D2. The defending team:
- the defending team tries to prevent an increase in pace or a targeted attacking action,
  through correct and active defensive methods;
- if the defending team tries to interrupt a pass sequence of the attacking team by
  committing infractions in accordance with Rule 8:3, this behaviour has to be
  consistently punished progressively.
  
##### D3. Notes concerning the maximum number of passes

###### D3a. Before the execution of the 6th pass:
- If the referees decide a free throw or a throw-in to the attacking team when the
  forewarning signal has been shown, it does not interrupt the count of passes.
- Similarly if a pass or a shot on goal is blocked by a court player of the defending team
  and the ball goes to the attacking team (even as a goalkeeper throw), it does not
  interrupt the count of passes.
  
###### D3b. After the execution of the 6th pass:
- If a free throw, a throw-in (or a goalkeeper throw) is awarded to the attacking team
  after the 6th pass, the team has the possibility of combining a throw with one
  additional pass to finish the attack.
- The same applies if the throw executed after the 6th pass is blocked by the defending
  team and the ball is directed to an attacking player or passes the side line or the outer
  goal line. In this case, the attacking team has the possibility of finishing the attack by
  making one additional pass.
  
#### E. Appendix

**Indications of a reduction of pace**

- Action sideways and not in depth towards the goal
- Frequent diagonal running in front of the defenders without putting any pressure on them
- No action in depth, such as confronting an opponent 1-on-1 or passing the ball to
  players between the goal-area line and the free throw line
- Repeated passing between two players with no clear increase of pace or actions
  towards the goal
- Passing of the ball with all positions involved (wing players, pivot and back-court
  players) with no clear increase of pace or recognisable actions towards the goal

**Indications of 1-on-1 actions where no spatial advantage is gained**

- 1-on-1 action in a situation where it is obvious that there is no room for a breakthrough
  (several opponents block the room for a break-through.)
- 1-on-1 action without any aim to break through towards the goal
- 1-on-1 action with the objective of simply being awarded a free throw (e.g., letting
  oneself ‘get stuck’, or ending the 1-on-1 action even though it might have been
  possible to break through)

**Indications of active defensive methods in conformity with the rules**

- Trying not to commit a foul, so as to avoid an interruption in the game
- Obstructing the running path of the attacker, perhaps by using two defenders
- Moving forward to block the passing routes
- Defenders moving forward to force the attackers further back in the court
- Provoking attackers to pass the ball far back into harmless positions 

### 5. Throw-Off (10:3)

As a guiding principle for the interpretation of Rule 10:3, the referees should keep in mind the
objective of encouraging teams to make use of a quick throw-off. This means that the referees
should avoid being pedantic and should not search for opportunities to call back or penalise a
team trying to throw quickly.

For instance, the referees must avoid letting note-taking or other tasks interfere with their
readiness to check the player positions quickly. The court referee should be ready to whistle at
the very moment when the thrower reaches the correct position, assuming that there is no
clear need for corrections of other player positions. The referees must also keep in mind that
the teammates of the thrower are allowed to move across the centre line as soon as the whistle
is blown. (This is an exception from the basic principle for the execution of formal throws.)

Although the rule states that the thrower must step on the centre line and be within 1.5 metre
from the centre, the referees should not be excessively precise and concerned about
centimetres. The main thing is to avoid unfairness and uncertainty for the opponents regarding
when and where the throw-off is taken.

Moreover, most courts do not have the centre point marked, and some courts may even have
the centre line interrupted due to advertising at the centre. In such cases, both the thrower and
the referee will obviously need to estimate the correct position, and any insistence on
exactness would then be unrealistic and inappropriate.

### 6. Definition of “Clear Chance of Scoring” (14:1)

For the purposes of Rule 14:1, a clear chance of scoring exists when:

- a) a player who already has ball and body control at the goal-area line of the opponents
  has the opportunity to shoot on goal, without any opponent being able to prevent the
  shot with legal methods.
  
  This also applies if the player does not yet have the ball but is ready for an immediate
  reception of the ball; there must not be an opponent in a position to prevent the
  reception of the ball with legal methods.
- b) a player who has ball and body control is running (or dribbling) alone towards the
  goalkeeper in a counter-attack, without any other opponent being able to come in front
  of him and stop the counter-attack.
  
  This also applies if the player does not yet have the ball but is ready for an immediate
  reception of the ball, and the opposing goalkeeper through a collision as under 8:5
  Comment prevents the reception of the ball; in this special case, the positions of the
  defending players are irrelevant.
- c) a goalkeeper has left his goal area and an opponent with ball and body control has a
  clear and unimpeded opportunity to throw the ball into the empty goal. 
  
### 7. Intervention by the Timekeeper or a Delegate (18:1)

If the timekeeper or a delegate intervenes, when the game is already interrupted, then the
game is restarted with the throw that corresponds to the reason for the interruption.
If the timekeeper or a delegate intervenes, and thereby interrupts the game when the ball is in
play, then the following regulations apply:

#### A. Faulty substitution or illegal entry by a player (Rules 4:2-3, 5-6)

The timekeeper (or delegate) must interrupt the game immediately, without regard for the
‘advantage’ concept under Rules 13:2 and 14:2. If due to such an interruption, due to violation
by the defending team, a clear chance of scoring is destroyed, then a 7-metre throw must be
awarded in accordance with Rule 14:1a. In all other cases, the game is restarted with a free
throw.

The guilty player is punished in accordance with Rule 16:3a. However, in the case of illegal
entry under Rule 4:6, during a clear chance of scoring, then the player is punished in
accordance with Rule 16:6b in conjunction with Rule 8:10b.

#### B. Interruption for other reasons, e.g., unsportsmanlike conduct in the substitution area

##### 1. Intervention by the timekeeper
The timekeeper should wait until the next interruption in the game and then inform the
referee.

If nevertheless the timekeeper interrupts the game while the ball is in play, then the game is
restarted with a free throw for the team that was in possession at the time of the interruption.

If the interruption is due to a violation by the defending team, and thereby a clear chance of
scoring is destroyed, then a 7-metre throw must be awarded in accordance with Rule 14:1b.

(The same applies if the timekeeper interrupts the game due to a request for a team time-out,
and the referees refuse the team time-out because the timing is wrong. If a clear chance of
scoring is destroyed due to the interruption, then a 7-metre throw must be awarded).

The timekeeper does not have the right to pronounce a punishment against a player or a team
official. The same applies to the referees, if they have not themselves observed the violation.
In such a case, they can only give an informal caution. If the reported violation falls under
Rules 8:6 or 8:10, they must submit a written report.

##### 2. Intervention by a delegate
Delegates from the IHF, a continental confederation or a national federation, who are on duty
in a game, have the right to inform the referees about a possible decision in violation of the
rules (except in the case of a referee decision on the basis of an observation of facts) or about
a violation of the substitution area regulations.

The delegate may interrupt the game immediately. In this case, the game is restarted with a
free throw for the team that did not commit the violation that led to the interruption.
If the interruption is caused by a violation from the defending team, and the interruption
causes a clear scoring chance to be destroyed, then a 7-metre throw in accordance with Rule
14:1a must be awarded.

The referees are obligated to give out personal punishments in accordance with the
instructions of the delegate.

The facts related to a violation of Rules 8:6 or 8:10 are to be reported in writing.

### 8. Injured Player (4:11)
If a player seems to be injured on the court, the following measures have to be taken:

- a) If the referees are absolutely sure that the injured player needs medical treatment on
  the field, they will immediately show the hand signals no. 15 and 16. Thus, the player
  has to meet the regulations of Rule 4:11 2nd paragraph after receiving treatment.
  
  In all the other cases, the referees will ask the player to go out to receive treatment
  outside the court. If this is not possible for the player concerned, the referees will show
  the hand signals no. 15 and 16. Rule 4:11, 2nd paragraph is applicable.
  
  Infractions of these regulations will be punished due to unsportsmanlike conduct.
  
  If a player, who has to leave the playing court during three attacks, is punished with a
  2-minute suspension, he is allowed to re-enter the court at the end of this suspension,
  regardless of the number of attacks played.
  
  If team officials refuse to provide the necessary treatment of a player, the ‘responsible
  team official’ is to be punished progressively (see Rule 4:2, 3rd paragraph).
- b) The timekeeper and the scorekeeper or the delegates are responsible for counting the
  number of attacks. They inform the team concerned as soon as the player is allowed to
  re-enter the court.
  
  An attack starts with the possession of the ball and ends when a goal is scored or the
  team in attack loses the ball.
  
  If the team is in possession of the ball when its player needs treatment, this attack is
  considered as the first attack.
- c) Rule 4:11 2nd paragraph does not apply in the following cases:
  - if the required treatment of injury on the playing court is the result of an illegal
    action by an opposing player who has been punished progressively by the referees;
  - if the goalkeeper’s head is hit by a ball and treatment inside the court is necessary

## Substitution Area Regulations

1. The substitution areas are situated outside the sideline, to the left and right of the extension
   of the centre line, up to end of the respective team benches (compatible with row of chairs,
   which is also permitted), and also behind them if there is space (Rules of the Game:
   diagram 1).
  
   The regulations for IHF and continental confederation events/competitions prescribe that
   the team benches, and thereby also the respective ‘coaching zones’, shall start at a distance
   of 3.5 metres from the centre line. This is also a recommendation for games at all other
   levels.
  
   No objects of any kind may be placed at the side line in front of the team benches (for at
   least 8 metres from the centre line).

2. Only the players and team officials entered in the score sheet are allowed to be in the
   substitution area (4:1-2).

   If an interpreter is needed, he must take up a position behind the substitution area.

3. The team officials in the substitution area must be fully dressed in sportswear or civilian
   clothing. Colours which may cause confusion with the court players of the opposing team
   are not allowed. 

4. The timekeeper and scorekeeper shall support the referees in monitoring the occupancy of
   the substitution area before and during the game.
  
   If before the game there are any infringements of the rules as regards the substitution area,
   the game must not start until the infringements have been remedied. If these rules are
   infringed during the game, the game must not be continued after the next interruption until
   the matter has been resolved.
   
5. The team officials have the right and duty to guide and manage their team also during the
   game, in a fair and sporting spirit within the framework of the rules. In principle, they
   should sit on the team bench.
  
   However, the officials are *permitted* to move around within the ‘coaching zone’. The
   ‘coaching zone’ is the area directly in front of the bench and, if this is feasible, also
   directly behind it.
  
   The movements and the positioning in the ‘coaching zone’ are allowed for the purposes of
   giving tactical advice and to provide medical care. In principle, only one official of the
   team is allowed to stand or move at a time. However, his position or his behaviour shall
   not interfere with the actions of the players who are on the court. In case of an infraction of
   these regulations, the official is to be punished progressively.
   
   It is, of course, permitted for one team official to leave the ‘coaching zone’ when he
   immediately wants to submit the ‘green card’ to request a team time-out. However, the
   team official is not allowed to leave the ‘coaching zone’ with the ‘green card’ and stand
   waiting at the table for the moment to request the team time-out.
   
   The ‘responsible team official’ may also leave the ‘coaching zone’ in special situations, for
   instance, for necessary contact with the timekeeper or scorekeeper.
   In principle, players in the substitution area should sit on the substitution bench.
   
   The players are however *permitted* to:
   - move around behind the bench to warm up, without ball, provided that there is
     sufficient space and that it is not disruptive.
   
   It is *not permitted* for team officials or players to:
   - interfere with or insult referees, delegates, timekeeper/scorekeeper, players, team
     officials, or spectators, by behaving in a provocative, protesting, or otherwise
     unsportsmanlike manner (speech, facial expression or gestures);
   - leave the substitution area in order to influence the game.
     
   Team officials and players are generally expected to remain in the substitution area of their
   team. If a team official nevertheless leaves the substitution area for another position, he
   loses the right to guide and manage his team and he must return to the substitution area to
   regain his right.
   
   More generally, players and team officials remain under the jurisdiction of the referees
   throughout the game, and the normal rules for personal punishments apply also if a player
   or official decides to take up a position away from the court and the substitution area.
   Therefore, unsportsmanlike conduct, seriously unsportsmanlike conduct, and extremely
   unsportsmanlike conduct are to be punished in the same manner as if the violation had
   taken place on the court or in the substitution area. 
   
6. If the Substitution Area Regulations are infringed, the referees or the delegates are obliged
   to act in accordance with the Rules 4:2 3rd paragraph, 16:1b, 16:3d-f or 16:6b-d (warning, suspension,
   disqualification).   
   
## Guidelines and Interpretations  

### Replacement of players and officials (Rules 4:1 – 4:2)

In the event that a team has not exhausted the maximum number of players (Rule 4:1) or
officials (Rule 4:2) permitted, it is allowed:

- to register someone as an official who was initially registered as a player
- to register someone as a player who was initially registered as an official

The maximum number of players and officials respectively must not be exceeded.

The player’s or the official’s original function shall be deleted in the match report. It is not
permitted to replace a player or an official in his original function which has meanwhile been
deleted. Furthermore it is not allowed to delete a participant having a certain function in order
to make a substitution in compliance with the maximum number permitted. It is not allowed
to register a person as both a player and an official.

The IHF, the continental confederations and the national federations have the right to apply
deviating regulations in their areas of responsibility.

Personal punishment resulting from changing the function (warning, suspension) shall be
considered for both the personal quota and the ‘player’ and ‘official’ quota respectively. 

### Markings of the playing court (Rule 1, Substitution Area Regulations Section 1)

The restraining line of the ‘coaching zone’ is provided for information purposes.
This line is 50 cm long and is drawn at a distance of 350 cm (outside the court, parallel to the
centre line). It begins at a distance of 30 cm at the outside of the side line (recommended
dimensions).

![Markings](diagrams/markings.png)

### Team Time-Out (Rule 2:10, Clarification No. 3)
The start of the last five minutes of the playing time begins when the clock indicates 55:00 or
05:00.

### Substitution of players (Rule 4:4)
Players shall always leave and enter the court over their own team’s substitution line. Injured
players who leave the court when playing time was interrupted are exempted.

Those players must not be forced to leave the court over the substitution line, where it is
obvious that they need medical treatment inside the substitution area or in the changing
rooms. Furthermore the referees should allow the substitute player to enter the court before
the injured player has left the court in order to keep interruption to a minimum.

### Additional players (Rule 4:6, 1st paragraph)

If an additional player enters the court without a substitution, there shall be a 2-minute
suspension for the player.

If it is not possible to identify the guilty player, the following steps shall be taken:
- The delegate or the referees respectively advise the ‘responsible team official’ to name the
  guilty player.
- The named player shall receive the 2-minute suspension as a personal punishment.
- In the event that the ‘responsible team official’ refuses to name the guilty player, the
  delegate or the referees respectively shall name a player. The named player shall receive a 2-
  minute suspension as a personal punishment.

***Note:***
- *Only players who are on the court at the time of the game interruption may be named the ‘guilty player’.*
- *In case the ‘guilty player’ receives the third suspension, he shall be disqualified according to Rule 16:6d*

### Forbidden objects, helmets, face and knee protections (Rule 4:9)
All types and sizes of face masks and helmets are forbidden. Not only full masks but also
masks to cover parts of the face are forbidden.

As far as knee protections are concerned, it is not permitted to wear metallic parts. The plastic
objects must be entirely padded.

As far as ankle joint protections are concerned, all hard parts made of metal or plastic must be
covered.

Elbow protection is allowed only if made of soft material.

Federations and referees are not allowed to grant any exceptions. However, if a responsible
team official addresses a delegate or a referee in case of doubt, they will make a decision on
the basis of the regulations of Rule 4:9 as well as the “Guidelines”. In this context, being “not
dangerous” and giving “no improper advantage” are the most important principles.

This decision was taken in coordination with the Medical Commission of the IHF.

For additional advice (recommended actions for referees and technical delegates), see
appendix 1 and appendix 2.

### Glue (Rule 4:9)
It is permitted to use glue. It is permitted to deposit glue on the shoes. This does not endanger
the opponent’s health.

However, it is not permitted to deposit glue on the hands or the wrist. This endangers the
opponents’ health, as glue might come into their eyes or their face. According to Rule 4:9 this
practice is not allowed.

National federations have the right to adopt additional restrictions for their area.

### Assisting injured players (Rule 4:11)
In cases where several players of the same team have been injured e.g. due to a collision, the
referees or the delegate may give permission for additional eligible persons to enter the court
in order to assist those injured players. Moreover the referees and the delegate monitor
paramedics who may enter the court.

### Injured goalkeeper (Rule 6:8)
The goalkeeper is hit by a ball in play and is incapable of acting. Generally in these cases the
protection of the goalkeeper must be given priority. In terms of restarting the game different
situations are possible:

- a) The ball passes the side line, the outer goal line, or is lying or rolling inside the goal
  area.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Immediate interruption of play, throw-in or goalkeeper
  throw in relation to the above cases, should be implemented to restart the game.
- b) The referees interrupted the game before the ball passed the side line or the outer goal
  line or before the ball was lying or rolling inside the goal-area.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Restarting the game with the throw that corresponds to
  the situation.
- c) The ball is in the air over the goal area.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Wait one or two seconds until one team gains possession
  of the ball, interrupt the game, restart the game with a free throw for the team in
  possession of the ball.
- d) The referee whistles in a moment when the ball is still in the air.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Restart the game with a free throw for the team that last
  has been in possession of the ball.
- e) The ball bounces from the goalkeeper incapable of acting back to an attacking player.
  
  Correct application of Rules: Interrupt the game immediately; restart the game with a
  free throw for the team in possession of the ball.
  
***Note:***

*In such cases a 7m throw is never possible. The referees interrupted the game
deliberately for the protection of the goalkeeper. Therefore it is not a question of an
‘unwarranted whistle’ according to Rule 14:1b.*

### Steps, start dribbling (Rule 7:3)
In compliance with Rule 7:3c,d putting down your foot for the first time after receiving the
ball during a jump is not considered as a step (zero contact). However, ‘ball reception’ means
receiving a pass.

Dribbling and catching the ball in the air during a jump is not considered as ‘ball reception’
according to the rule. Putting down your foot after dribbling has started is therefore without
exception considered as a step.

### Counting the number of passes after the forewarning signal (7:11)
See training support in appendix 3.

### Intervention by additional players or officials (Rules 8:5, 8:6, 8:9, 8:10b)
In cases where additional players or officials intervene, the decision on punishment and
continuation of play are subject to the following criteria:
- player or official
- destroying a clear chance of scoring

Due to the named criteria the following situations could occur:
a) During a clear chance of scoring an additional player who has not been involved
- in a substitution process is present on the court.
  
  Correct application of Rules: 7m throw, disqualification to be reported in writing
- b) Incorrect substitution: The timekeeper/delegate whistles during a clear chance of
  scoring.
  
  Correct application of Rules: 7m throw, 2min suspension.
- c) During a clear chance of scoring a team official enters the court.
  
  Correct application of Rules: 7m throw, disqualification to be reported in writing.
- d) As under c), but no clear chance ofscoring.
  
  Correct application of Rules: free throw, progressive punishment.

### Further measures after a disqualification to be reported in writing (Rules 8:6, 8:10a, b)
The criteria for this highest level of punishment are defined in Rules 8:6 (for illegal
behaviour) and 8:10 (for unsportsmanlike behaviour); see also Rule 8:3 section 2.

As the consequences of a punishment according to rule 8:6 or 8:10, during the game, do not
differ from the penalty according to rules 8:5 and 8:9 (disqualification not to be reported in
writing) the IHF added the following supplementary provision to both rules:
“... they must submit a written report after the game, so that the responsible authorities are in a
position to take a decision about further measures.”

This supplementary provision builds the principle for the responsible authority to decide
about the intended further measures. Not at all the wording of the rule “... are in position” may
be interpreted as a discretion of the responsible authority, if further measures are taken. This
would mean a change of fact-finding of the referees. Any enhancement of the disqualification
punishment should not be reported in writing as intended by the IHF, and therefore is no
longer necessary.

### Criteria for disqualification not to be reported / to be reported in writing (Rules 8:5, 8:6)
The following criteria assist in distinguishing between Rule 8:5 and Rule 8:6:
- a) What defines ‘particularly reckless’?
  - assaults and assault-similar actions
  - ruthless or irresponsible actions without any sense of proper behaviour
  - unrestrained hitting
  - malevolent actions
- b) What defines ‘particularly dangerous’?
  - actions against an unprotected opponent
  - extremely risky and serious actions endangering the opponent’s health
- c) What defines ‘premeditated action’?
  - intentional and deliberately committed malicious action
  - wilful action against the body of the opponent just to destroy the opponent’s action
- d) What defines ‘malicious action’?
  - sneaky and hidden action against the unprepared opponent
- e) What defines ‘without any relation to the game situation’?
  - actions committed far away from the player in possession of the ball
  - actions without any relation to game tactics

### Court player entering the goal area (8:7f)
If a team is playing without a goalkeeper and loses the ball, a court player of this team who is
entering the team’s own goal area to gain an advantage is to be punished progressively.

### Spitting (Rules 8:9, 8:10a)
Spitting at someone is considered an assault-similar action and must be punished in
accordance with 8:10a (disqualification to be reported in writing). Differentiation between
‘successful spitting’ (punishment according to Rule 8:10) and ‘unsuccessful spitting’ (attempt,
punishment according to Rule 8:9), which was previously introduced, remains unchanged.

### Last 30 seconds (Rules 8:10c, 8:10d)
The last 30 seconds of the game occur during regular playing time (end of 2nd half) as well as
at the end of the second half during both overtime periods. The start of the last 30 seconds of
the game begins when the clock indicates 59 minutes 30 seconds (or 69:30, 79:30) or 0
minutes 30 seconds.

### Not respecting the distance (Rule 8:10c)
“Not respecting the distance” only leads to a disqualification + 7m throw, if a throw during
the last 30 seconds of the game (!) cannot be executed.

If the throw is executed and blocked by a player standing too close, normal progressive
punishment shall be applied during the last 30 seconds of the game too, as the ball has left the
hand of the thrower (see Rule 15:2 1st paragraph).

The Rule is applicable if the infraction is committed during the last 30 seconds of the game
or at the same time as the final signal (see Rule 2:4, 1
st paragraph). In this case, the referees
will make a decision on the basis of their observations of facts (Rule 17:11).

If the game is interrupted during the last 30 seconds due to an interference that is not directly
related to the preparation or the execution of a throw (for example faulty substitution,
unsportsmanlike conduct in the substitution area), Rule 8:10c is to be applied.

### Disqualification during the last 30 seconds (Rule 8:10d)
In case of a disqualification of a defending player according to Rules 8:5 and 8:6 during the
last 30 seconds of the game, only infractions according to Rule 8:6 Comment lead to a
disqualification to be reported in writing + 7m throw. Infractions of a defending player
according to Rule 8:5 during the last 30 seconds of the game lead to a disqualification not to
be reported in writing + 7m throw.

### Gaining an advantage during the last 30 seconds (8:10d, last paragraph)
The referees interrupt the game and award a 7m at the latest when the player receiving a pass
does not score a goal or continues the game by making another pass.

Rule 8:10d is applicable if the infraction is committed during the playing time or at the same
time as the final signal (see Rule 2:4, 1st paragraph). In this case, the referees will make a
decision on the basis of their observations of facts (Rule 17:11).

A disqualification of the goalkeeper according to Rule 8:5 Comment (Leaving the goal area)
leads to a 7m throw during the last 30 seconds of the game if the conditions according to Rule
8:5, last paragraph, are fulfilled or an infraction is committed according to Rule 8:6. 

### Throw-in execution (Rule 11:4)
A throw-in is executed in the direction of the playing court as direct throw passing the side
line.

### Execution of a throw (Rule 15)
Rule 15:7, 3
rd paragraph and Rule 15:8 include examples of possible faults when executing a
throw. Dribbling and putting the ball down on the floor (before taking it up again) is an
infraction, as well as having the ball in contact with the floor when executing a throw
(exception: goalkeeper throw).

In this case, faults are also to be treated according to the regulations of Rule 15:7 and 15:8
(correction or punishment).

### Disqualified players / officials (Rule 16:8)
Disqualified players and officials must leave the court and the substitution area immediately
and must not have any contact with their team afterwards.

In cases where the referees recognise another infraction committed by a disqualified player or
official, after restarting the game, must be reported in writing.

It is not possible, however, to extend further punishments in the game against the player or
official concerned, and therefore, their behaviour must not lead to a reduction in the number
of players on the court. This is also valid in the event that a disqualified player enters the
court.

### Spectators behaving in a way to endanger players (Rule 17:12)
Rule 17:12 is also to be applied if spectators are behaving in a way to endanger players, for
example by using a laser pointer or throwing different type of objects. In this case, the
following measures are to be taken:

- if necessary, the game is suspended immediately and is not continued;
- the spectators are asked to stop disturbing the game;
- if necessary, spectators are removed from the corresponding stands and the game is
  only re-started when all spectators concerned have left the hall;
- the home team is asked to take additional safety measures;
- written report.

If the game has already been suspended when detecting the irregularity, Rule 13:3 (by
analogy) is applicable.

If the game is suspended at the time of a clear chance of scoring, Rule 14:1c is applicable.
In all the other cases, a free throw has to be awarded to the team having been in possession of
the ball from the spot where the ball was when play was interrupted.

and other objects not allowed (Rule 4:9)
2) Equipment permitted and not permitted to wear (4:9), illustrated documentation
3) Training support “6 passes” 

### Appendix 1

**Additional advice on face masks ban and other objects not allowed (Rule 4:9)**

The IHF-PRC regularly receives requests for a statement or even for granting exceptions
regarding certain kinds of face masks, although additional notes included in the Guidelines
and Interpretations applicable explicitly indicate the total ban on the use of face masks.

Generally speaking the main argument of the questioner or the applicant is a corresponding
personal judgment saying that the face mask concerned, usually with corresponding pictures
documented, does not pose a danger to the players’ health. Nevertheless the IHF Medical
Commission indicated all types and sizes of face masks in their recommendation about the
ban on such equipment. Thus there would be no room for interpretation even if the face mask
concerned did not pose a danger to others.

However, it is reported from time to time that individual clubs or players referring to the
alleged non-existence of danger to others intend defying the named ban on the use of face
masks to cause additional problems in the decision-making process for referees and Technical
Delegates officiating in the relevant match.

Due to the aforementioned the IHF-PRC herewith releases the following recommendations
including the attached scheme for referees and timekeepers or technical delegates respectively
in order to amend the provisions stipulated in Rules 4:9 and 17:3, 2nd paragraph, and the
statements included in the Guidelines and Interpretations applicable.

**A player wearing a face mask intends participating in the game!**

The measures to be decided by the referees mainly depend on the moment in time of the first
and, when applicable, the follow-up identification.

In case the infraction is identified for the first time, the guilty player and ‘responsible team
official’ A shall basically be advised of the ban on the use of face masks. The guilty player
shall be told to correct the problem and will only be allowed to participate in the game if the
deficiency is corrected. If the player is advised for the first time, he shall not be given a
personal/progressive punishment.

If a player is unrepentant despite appropriate advice, the first follow-up identification is
warranted as more severe unsportsmanlike conduct and must be punished with a 2-minute
suspension in accordance with 8:8a (exception for rule-specific reasons, see situation 1.2 as
below). In addition the player is invited again to correct the problem.

Should the infraction be identified a second time, it will be considered as seriously
unsportsmanlike conduct, and the guilty player shall receive a disqualification (without being
reported) in accordance with 8:9.

In the opinion of the IHF-PRC the following scenarios, which in parts might indeed be
rather hypothetical - may occur:

1.1 If the infraction in accordance with 4:9 is recognised before the start of the game (during
the warm-up), the player and ‘responsible team official’ A are advised of the ban in
accordance to 17:3, 2nd paragraph).

The player shall be told to remove his face mask (Rule 4:9; Guidelines and Interpretations).
The player and ‘responsible team official’ A shall be advised that in case such infraction of
4:9 occurs a second time it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike behaviour according to
17:5, 2nd paragraph, and the introduction of 8:7, to result into progressive punishment for the
player in accordance with 8:8a or 8:9.

1.2 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the playing court at the start of the
match anyway, the match shall not be started.
The guilty player shall be given a warning according to 16:11, 2nd paragraph, point a.
The player with the face mask must leave the playing court.
He may only participate in the game if the problem is corrected.

1.3 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the playing court during the match,
the referees or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively must give a time- out to
interrupt the match immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
In accordance with 8:8 a (provocative behaviour) the guilty player shall be punished with a
2min suspension (16:3 f).
The player must then leave the playing court to correct the problem.
The player will be allowed to participate in the match again after expiration of his 2-minute
suspension and after having corrected the problem.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1a (7-
metre throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

1.4 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the court a second time during the
match, the referee or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively must give a time-out to
interrupt the match immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
The player's repeated misconduct is considered as seriously unsportsmanlike conduct in
accordance with 8:9.
The player shall be disqualified in accordance with 16:6 b.
The provisions laid down in 16:7 and 16:8, paragraphs 1 – 4, are to be observed.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

2.1 In the event that the infraction is not recognised or identified by the referees before the
start of the game (during the warm-up), a player who is on the court when the match is started
shall be told to correct the problem according to 4:9.
The match must not be started as long as the guilty player is on the court.
The player and ‘responsible team official’ A are advised that in case such infraction of 4:9
occurs a second time it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike conduct according to 17:5, 2nd
paragraph, and the introduction of 8:7, to result into progressive punishment for the player in
accordance with 8:8a or 8:9.
Then the throw-off shall be taken as usual (10:1, 1st paragraph).

2.2 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the playing court during the match
with the infraction previously not being noticed or recognised by the referees or
timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively, a time-out shall be decided to interrupt the match
immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
The player shall be told to correct the problem in accordance with 4:9.
The player and ‘responsible team official’ A are advised that in case such infraction of 4:9
occurs a second time it shall be considered as unsportsmanlike behaviour according to 17:5,
2nd paragraph, and the introduction of 8:7, to result into progressive punishment for the player
in accordance with 8:8a or 8:9.
The match shall be restarted with a free throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

2.3 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the court again despite the
aforementioned advice, the referees or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively shall
give a time-out to interrupt the match immediately due to the potential risk of endangering
others.
In accordance with 8:8 a (provocative behaviour) the offending player shall receive a 2min
suspension (16:3 f).
The player must then leave the playing court to correct the problem.
The player will be allowed to participate in the match again after expiration of his 2min
suspension and after having corrected the problem.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

2.4 In the event that the player wearing a face mask enters the court again during the game,
the referees or the timekeeper/Technical Delegate respectively shall give a time-out to
interrupt the game immediately due to the potential risk of endangering others.
The player's repeated misconduct is considered as seriously unsportsmanlike conduct in
accordance to 8:9.
The player shall be disqualified according to 16:6 b.

The provisions laid down in 16:7 and 16:8, paragraphs 1 – 4, shall be observed.
The match shall be restarted with a free-throw for the opposing team according to 13:1 a (7m
throw in case the match was interrupted at the time of a clear scoring chance (14:1a).

### Appendix 2

## Guidelines for Playing Courts and Goals

- a) The playing court (diagram 1) consists of a rectangle which measures 40 x 20m. It
  should be checked by measuring the length of the two diagonals. From the outer side
  of one corner to the outside of the opposite corner they should measure 44.72m. The
  length of the diagonals for one half of the court should measure 28.28m from the
  outside of each of the corners to the opposite outer middle of the centre line.
  
  The playing court is provided with marking lines which are called “lines”. The width
  of the goal lines (between the goalposts) is 8cm like the goalposts, all other lines have
  a width of 5cm. Lines which separate adjacent areas of the playing court can be
  replaced by a change in colours between the adjacent areas.

- b) The goal area in front of the goals consists of a 3 x 6m rectangle and two connecting
  quarter circle sectors each with a radius of 6m. It is constructed by drawing a 3m long
  line parallel to the goal line at a distance of 6m from the rear edge of the goal line to
  the front edge of the goal-area line. On both sides this line continues in two quartercircle
  arcs with the centre at the rear inside edge of the respective goalposts and with a
  radius of 6m. The lines and arcs which enclose the goal area are called the goal area
  line. The outer distance between the points where the two arcs meet the outer goal line
  in this way will measure 15m (diagram 5).
- c) The broken free throw line (9m line) is made parallel and concentric to the goal-area
  line with a 3m larger distance from the goal line. The segments as well as the spaces
  between them measure 15cm. The segments should be cut off right-angled and radially
  respectively. The measurements of the curved segments are taken over the outer chord
  (diagram 5).
- d) The 1m long 7-metre line is drawn directly in front of the goal, parallel to the goal
  line, at a distance of 7m from the rear edge of the goal line to the front edge of the 7m
  line (diagram 5). 
- e) The goalkeeper’s restraining line (the 4m line) directly in front of the goal is 15cm
  long. It is parallel to, and 4m away from, the goal line measured from the rear edge of
  the goal line to the front edge of the 4m line, which means that the widths of both lines
  are included in this measure.
- f) The playing area should be surrounded by a safety zone of at least 1m along the side
  line  s and 2m behind the outer goal lines.
- g) The goal (diagram 2) is placed in the centre of each outer goal line. The goals must be
  firmly attached to the floor or to the wall behind them. The interior measures are 3m in
  width and 2m in height. The goal frame must be a rectangle, which means that the
  inside diagonals will measure 360.5cm (max. 361cm – min. 360cm, in one and the
  same goal the difference must be maximum 0.5cm).
  
  The rear side of the goalposts shall be in line with the rear edge of the goal line (and
  the outer goal line), which means that the front side of the goalposts is placed 3cm in
  front of the outer goal line.
  
  The goalposts and the horizontal crossbar which joins them shall be made of a uniform
  material (e.g. wood, light metal or synthetic material) and have a square cross section
  of 8cm with rounded edges with a rounding radius of 4±1mm. On the three sides
  which are visible from the court, the goalposts and the crossbar must be painted in
  bands of two colours which contrast clearly with each other and with the background;
  the two goals on one and the same playing court must have the same colours.
  
  The colour bands of the goals measure in the corner between posts and bar 28cm in
  each direction in the same colour. All other colour bands shall be 20cm long. The
  goals must have a net, called goal net, which must be attached in such a way that a ball
  thrown into the goal cannot immediately rebound or pass through the goal. If
  necessary, an additional net, placed in the goal behind the goal line can be used. The
  distance from the goal line to this additional net should be approximately 70cm, but
  minimum 60cm.
- h) The depth of the goal net should at the top be 0.9m behind the goal line, and at the
  bottom 1.1m, both measures with a tolerance of ± 0.1m. The size of the meshes should
  not be more than 10 x 10cm. The net must be fixed to the post and the crossbar at least
  at every 20cm. It is allowed to bind together the goal net and the additional net in such
  a way that no ball can go between the two nets.
- i) Behind the goal in the middle of the outer goal line at a distance of approximately
  1.5m, there should be a vertical barrage net with a length of 9 - 14m and a height of
  5m from the floor.
- j) In the middle of the substitution area at one of the side lines the table for the
  timekeeper is placed. The table of a length of max. 4m should be placed 30-40cm
  above the floor of the playing court in order to secure the field of vision.
- k) All measurements without specification of a tolerance must correspond to the ISONorm
  (International Standard Organization -ISO 27681:1989).
- l) Handball goals are standardised by the European Committee for Standardization, CEN
  (Comité Européen de Normalisation) as EN 749 in connection with EN 202.10-1.
